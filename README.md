## Knife-Detection-using-SSD-Deep-Learning-Model

This repository contains the code for training an SSD deep learning model architecture for the detection of knifes that appears in images. Moreover, Inceptin V2 is used as the base network. For development, [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) is used.

## Data

Data was downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ari-dasci/OD-WeaponDetection/tree/master/Knife_detection) directly into google drive in the Jupyter Note code.

## Results

Some detection results along with confidence score, after training for 200k steps:
